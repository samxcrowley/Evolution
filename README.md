A simple simulation of Evolution and Natural Selection.

Each 'Blip' is a very basic organism which has tendencies to move in each direction or stay put each step. The Blips will then reproduce at the end of each generation to create a new set of Blips with inherited tendencies.

There will be different ways to choose which Blips reproduce and which do not, and this will be changed to see how it influences the tendencies of the Blips. For example, at the end of each generation perhaps only the Blips in the right half of the grid will reproduce. It would be expected, then, that Blips would begin to evolve to move mostly towards the right over time.
